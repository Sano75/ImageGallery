This is a school project, a simple Image Gallery
Created by Sano Gharzani with big help of youtube and StackOverflow.

Simple gallery using SQLite to store chosen pictures, wich are limited by size.
When you are looking in the photo list and long klick on a photo you can update or delete a photo.
If the photo you try to upload is to big, it's going to be deleted from automaticly.

Enjoy :)
